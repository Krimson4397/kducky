> DuckyScript 3 Interpreter for Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350) · CircuitPython 10.x  

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project name:** kducky  
**Purpose:** A modular, portable DuckyScript 3 interpreter that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, allowing users to execute USB Rubber Ducky payloads from an embedded microcontroller.  
**Target hardware:** Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350) — CircuitPython 10.x  
**Supported language:** DuckyScript 3 (Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky language) with project extensions  
**Current status:** Planning phase complete. Awaiting Milestone 1 (Repository Scaffold).  
**High-level architecture:** Language modules (Lexer → Parser → AST → Interpreter) communicate through well-defined interfaces and are fully decoupled from hardware. A PlatformInterface layer abstracts all hardware I/O, enabling the same interpreter code to run on desktop CPython (for development and testing) and on CircuitPython (for production). The language core never imports CircuitPython.

## 2. Project Authority

The following documents are the **only authoritative** project documents. Every AI agent **must** read them completely before making any change. Read them in this exact order:

1. `plans/DuckyScript3_Engineering_Spec.md` — Frozen language specification, grammar, runtime semantics, Platform API, architecture rules.
2. `plans/DuckyScript3_Implementation_Roadmap.md` — 20 milestones with dependencies, acceptance criteria, and build order.
3. `plans/Development_Workflow.md` — Day-to-day workflow: milestone process, spec rules, git workflow, implementation principles.

**Do NOT use:** `plans/spec.md` — exists only as a historical artifact from early design work. It is not authoritative and must not influence implementation.

**Conflict resolution:** If the Engineering Specification and any other document (including this one) conflict, the Engineering Specification wins.

---

## 3. Startup Checklist

Before writing any code, an AI agent must:

- [ ] Read all three planning documents (Section 2 above).
- [ ] Review the latest Session Handoff (§8).
- [ ] Verify the current Git branch.
- [ ] Verify the working tree is clean (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes).
- [ ] Verify which milestone is active (from Session Handoff).
- [ ] Confirm the acceptance criteria for that milestone (from the roadmap).

Only after completing the checklist may implementation begin.

- All implementation code belongs under `src/`.
- All tests belong under `tests/`.
- Modern Python src layout — install with `pip install -e .`.

## 5. Development Principles

Project priorities, in order:

1. **Correctness** — Behavior matches the Engineering Specification.
2. **Maintainability** — Clear, well-structured code.
3. **Portability** — Translatable to C/C++ without redesign.
4. **Testability** — Every module testable in isolation on desktop Python.
5. **Performance** — Fast enough for the target hardware.

Never sacrifice a higher-priority criterion for a lower one. Never optimize prematurely.

---

## 6. Working Rules

Every AI agent **must**:

- Work on exactly **one** milestone at a time.
- **Never work ahead** — do not write code for future milestones.
- **Never modify future milestones** in the planning documents.
- **Never silently change the architecture** defined in the spec.
- **Never silently change language behavior** defined in the spec.
- **Never ignore acceptance criteria** for the current milestone.
- **Never skip tests** — all tests must pass before a milestone is complete.
- **Never leave placeholder implementations** unless explicitly approved.
- **Stop immediately** if an ambiguity or spec conflict is discovered.
- **Wait for user approval** before beginning the next milestone.

---

## 7. Git Workflow

Every completed milestone = exactly **one** commit.

### Process

1. Complete implementation.
2. Complete all tests.
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are met.
4. Review all modified files (`git diff`).
5. Run formatting, linting, and type checking (`ruff check src/ tests/ && mypy src/ tests/`).
6. Stage only the files belonging to this milestone.
7. Create exactly one commit.

### Commit message format

```
Milestone X: <short description>
```

**Examples:**

```
Milestone 1: Repository scaffold
Milestone 2: Token definitions
Milestone 3: Lexer implementation
```

**Never** combine multiple milestones into a single commit. **Never** commit unfinished work.

---

## 8. Session Handoff

This section **must** be updated at the completion of every milestone. It describes the current state of the repository for the next AI agent.

### Handoff Summary

| Field                 | Value                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Project Version       | 0.0.0 (pre-release)              |
| Completed Milestone   | None — planning phase complete   |
| Current Branch        | Not yet initialized              |
| Last Commit           | None                             |
| Repository Status     | Empty (no code yet)              |
| Next Milestone        | M1 — Repository Scaffold         |
| Blocking Issues       | None                             |
| Ready to Continue     | YES (awaiting user approval)     |

### Files Created

None yet.

### Files Modified

None yet.

### Tests Executed

### Acceptance Criteria Completed

None yet.

### Remaining Milestones

All 20 milestones from the implementation roadmap.

### Known Issues

None.

### Technical Debt

### Assumptions Made

None yet.

### Notes for the Next Session

The project is at the starting line. All three planning documents are in `plans/`. The engineering spec is frozen. The development workflow is documented. The next step is to obtain user approval for Milestone 1 — Repository Scaffold, which will create the package structure, toolchain configuration, and test infrastructure. No code changes have been made yet.

## 9. Continuation Prompt

At the end of every milestone, generate a ready-to-copy continuation prompt and place it here. It should look like:

```
Continue development of the kducky project.

Before making any changes:
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read the three planning documents under plans/.
3. Read the latest Session Handoff in AGENTS.md (§8).
4. Verify the Git working tree is clean.
5. Resume from Milestone X.

Do not repeat completed milestones.
Wait for approval before beginning the next milestone.
```

---

## 10. Updating AGENTS.md

At the end of every milestone, the AI agent **must**:

1. Update the Session Handoff (§8) — all subsections.
2. Update the Handoff Summary table.
3. Update the Continuation Prompt (§9).
4. Save `AGENTS.md`.
5. Inform the user that `AGENTS.md` has been updated.
6. Wait for user approval before beginning the next milestone.

Failure to update AGENTS.md before concluding a session risks the next agent losing project context.
