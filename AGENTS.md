# AGENTS.md — Project Operating Manual

> DuckyScript 3 Interpreter for Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350) · CircuitPython 10.x  

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project name:** kducky  
**Purpose:** A modular, portable DuckyScript 3 interpreter that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, allowing users to execute USB Rubber Ducky payloads from an embedded microcontroller.  
**Target hardware:** Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350) — CircuitPython 10.x  
**Supported language:** DuckyScript 3 (Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky language) with project extensions  
**Current status:** Milestone 2 complete. M3 — Lexer is next.  
**High-level architecture:** Language modules (Lexer → Parser → AST → Interpreter) communicate through well-defined interfaces and are fully decoupled from hardware. A PlatformInterface layer abstracts all hardware I/O, enabling the same interpreter code to run on desktop CPython (for development and testing) and on CircuitPython (for production). The language core never imports CircuitPython.

## 2. Project Authority

The following documents are the **only authoritative** project documents. Every AI agent **must** read them completely before making any change. Read them in this exact order:

1. `plans/DuckyScript3_Engineering_Spec.md` — Frozen language specification, grammar, runtime semantics, Platform API, architecture rules.
2. `plans/DuckyScript3_Implementation_Roadmap.md` — 20 milestones with dependencies, acceptance criteria, and build order.
3. `plans/Development_Workflow.md` — Day-to-day workflow: milestone process, spec rules, git workflow, implementation principles.

**Do NOT use:** `plans/spec.md` — exists only as a historical artifact from early design work. It is not authoritative and must not influence implementation.

**Conflict resolution:** If the Engineering Specification and any other document (including this one) conflict, the Engineering Specification wins.

---

## 3. Startup Checklist

Before writing any code, an AI agent must:

- [ ] Read all three planning documents (Section 2 above).
- [ ] Review the latest Session Handoff (§8).
- [ ] Verify the current Git branch.
- [ ] Verify the working tree is clean (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes).
- [ ] Verify which milestone is active (from Session Handoff).
- [ ] Confirm the acceptance criteria for that milestone (from the roadmap).

Only after completing the checklist may implementation begin.

- All implementation code belongs under `src/`.
- All tests belong under `tests/`.
- Modern Python src layout — install with `pip install -e .`.

## 5. Development Principles

Project priorities, in order:

1. **Correctness** — Behavior matches the Engineering Specification.
2. **Maintainability** — Clear, well-structured code.
3. **Portability** — Translatable to C/C++ without redesign.
4. **Testability** — Every module testable in isolation on desktop Python.
5. **Performance** — Fast enough for the target hardware.

Never sacrifice a higher-priority criterion for a lower one. Never optimize prematurely.

---

## 6. Working Rules

Every AI agent **must**:

- Work on exactly **one** milestone at a time.
- **Never work ahead** — do not write code for future milestones.
- **Never modify future milestones** in the planning documents.
- **Never silently change the architecture** defined in the spec.
- **Never silently change language behavior** defined in the spec.
- **Never ignore acceptance criteria** for the current milestone.
- **Never skip tests** — all tests must pass before a milestone is complete.
- **Never leave placeholder implementations** unless explicitly approved.
- **Stop immediately** if an ambiguity or spec conflict is discovered.
- **Wait for user approval** before beginning the next milestone.

---

## 7. Git Workflow

Every completed milestone = exactly **one** commit.

### Process

1. Complete implementation.
2. Complete all tests.
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are met.
4. Review all modified files (`git diff`).
5. Run formatting, linting, and type checking (`ruff check src/ tests/ && mypy src/ tests/`).
6. Stage only the files belonging to this milestone.
7. Create exactly one commit.

### Commit message format

```
Milestone X: <short description>
```

**Examples:**

```
Milestone 1: Repository scaffold
Milestone 2: Token definitions
Milestone 3: Lexer implementation
```

**Never** combine multiple milestones into a single commit. **Never** commit unfinished work.

---

## 8. Session Handoff

This section **must** be updated at the completion of every milestone. It describes the current state of the repository for the next AI agent.

### Handoff Summary

| Field                 | Value                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Project Version       | 0.1.0 (alpha)                    |
| Completed Milestone   | M2 — Token Definitions           |
| Current Branch        | main                             |
| Last Commit           | f281f9b                          |
| Repository Status     | Clean working tree               |
| Next Milestone        | M3 — Lexer                       |
| Blocking Issues       | None                             |
| Ready to Continue     | YES (awaiting user approval)     |

### Files Created

- `src/ducky/tokens.py` — TokenType enum (176 members), Token dataclass, Operator/ModifierKey/ActionKey enums
- `tests/test_tokens.py` — 46 tests covering value uniqueness, presence of every spec key, instantiation, immutability, and import hygiene

### Files Modified

- `AGENTS.md` — Updated Session Handoff

### Tests Executed

- `pip install -e ".[dev]"` — Installed `ducky` package (with new tokens module)
- `pytest -v` — 46 passed in 0.10s
- `ruff check src/ducky/tokens.py tests/test_tokens.py` — All checks passed
- `mypy src/ducky/tokens.py tests/test_tokens.py` — No issues found

### Acceptance Criteria Completed

- [x] Every keyword from spec §1.3 has a TokenType member
- [x] Every operator from spec §1.8 has an Operator member
- [x] Every modifier key from spec §1.4 has both TokenType and ModifierKey members
- [x] Every action key from spec §1.5 has both TokenType and ActionKey members
- [x] Token data class works with type, value, line, column (frozen dataclass)
- [x] No imports from outside standard library (only `enum`, `dataclasses`, `__future__`)
- [x] All 46 tests pass

### Remaining Milestones

Milestones 3–20 from the implementation roadmap.

### Known Issues

None.

### Technical Debt

None.

### Assumptions Made

None.

### Notes for the Next Session

Milestone 2 is complete. `src/ducky/tokens.py` defines the shared vocabulary for the lexer and parser: `TokenType` (176 auto-valued members covering every keyword, operator token, modifier key, and action key including REM/REM_BLOCK/END_REM), `Token` (frozen dataclass with type/value/line/column), `Operator` (20 operators with string values), `ModifierKey` (8 modifier names), and `ActionKey` (69 action keys). All enums use `auto()` or string values per spec, with naming disambiguations (`RETURN_KEY`, `END_KEY`, `BREAK_KEY`) for spec keywords vs action keys that share names. The next milestone (M3 — Lexer) will consume these token types.

## 9. Continuation Prompt

```
Continue development of the kducky project.

Before making any changes:
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read the three planning documents under plans/.
3. Read the latest Session Handoff in AGENTS.md (§8).
4. Verify the Git working tree is clean.
5. Resume from Milestone 3 — Lexer.

Do not repeat completed milestones.
Wait for approval before beginning the next milestone.
```

---

## 10. Updating AGENTS.md

At the end of every milestone, the AI agent **must**:

1. Update the Session Handoff (§8) — all subsections.
2. Update the Handoff Summary table.
3. Update the Continuation Prompt (§9).
4. Save `AGENTS.md`.
5. Inform the user that `AGENTS.md` has been updated.
6. Wait for user approval before beginning the next milestone.

Failure to update AGENTS.md before concluding a session risks the next agent losing project context.
